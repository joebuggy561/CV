    <h2><em>Founder of <strong><a href="#">Hundred<a>, <a href="https://joebuggy561.github.io/Torexchange/">Torexhange<a>,</strong><strong>Data Analyst</strong> and <strong>Python Dev.</strong></em></h2>
    <p>The transition from basic notebook coding to data define programming has been fascinating in  equal measure.
                    I've learnt how to use data to gain insights that can assist in real-world situations.
                    During the period I spent as a trainee in NIIT I was trained in areas of Data wrangling, cleaning,
                    manipulation, visualization, piping, creating dashboards and modeling which are just a few of the skills
                    I gained at NIIT using platforms such as Excel, SSMS, Python, RStudio etc.</p>

      <h3>MSSQL</h3>
      <p>I have spent the last year and half, training in areas of maintaining Databases,
        reporting, data management, processing, Utilizing Query, Reporting, and understanding its Architecture.</p>

      <h3>PYTHON</h3>
      <p>My love for this language goes beyond a few lines of text. I have spent
        the last six months studying various libraries such as Selenium for Bot creation,
        Flask for web apps, Pandas for analysis. The fact that the language can be used not
        only for OOP but also for web development, Phone apps and Analysis make the programming language very intriguing to learn </p>

      <h3>EXCEL</h3>
      <p>I enjoy excel not only because of its simplicity but also the fact that it can be quite
        versatile and very user friend for beginners. It does not require any form of library neither
        does it require extensive programming knowledge. I began my computing journey with this software
        and I really enjoyed it.que vel eu, rutrum nam.</p>
